AlphaCode is a fork of Visual Studio Code that adds integrated AI capabilities including chat, code editing proposals, and multi-provider AI integration (Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure, local models). It combines the simplicity and power of VS Code with AI-powered assistance for your development workflow.

AlphaCode provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and AI-powered features that help you write better code faster.

## Bundled Extensions

AlphaCode includes a set of built-in extensions located in the [extensions](extensions) folder, including grammars and snippets for many languages. Extensions that provide rich language support (code completion, Go to Definition) for a language have the suffix `language-features`. For example, the `json` extension provides coloring for `JSON` and the `json-language-features` extension provides rich language support for `JSON`.

## Development Container

This repository includes a Dev Containers / GitHub Codespaces development container.

* For Dev Containers, use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.

* For Codespaces, install the GitHub Codespaces extension and use the **Codespaces: Create New Codespace** command.

Docker / the Codespace should have at least **4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)** to run a full build. See the [development container README](.devcontainer/README.md) for more information.
