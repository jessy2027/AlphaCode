# Contributing to AlphaCode

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to AlphaCode!

There are several ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Asking Questions

Have a question? Please open a [discussion](https://github.com/jessy2027/AlphaCodeIDE/discussions) or file an issue.

## Providing Feedback

Your comments and feedback are welcome! Please use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/jessy2027/AlphaCodeIDE/issues) to share your thoughts.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in AlphaCode? Do you have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can report your issue as effectively as possible.

### Identify Where to Report

The AlphaCode project is primarily contained in this repository. If you find an issue is caused by an extension you have installed, please file an issue on the extension's repo directly.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/jessy2027/AlphaCodeIDE/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

Be sure to scan through the [most popular](https://github.com/jessy2027/AlphaCodeIDE/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) feature requests.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* 👍 - upvote
* 👎 - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Version of AlphaCode
* Your operating system
* List of extensions that you have installed
* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue
* What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw
* Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring
* A code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository the developers can easily pull down to recreate the issue locally
  * **Note:** Because the developers need to copy and paste the code snippet, including a code snippet as a media file (i.e. .gif) is not sufficient.
* Errors from the Dev Tools Console (open from the menu: Help > Toggle Developer Tools)

### Creating Pull Requests

* Please create a pull request with a clear description of the changes and why they are needed
* Reference any related issues
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting

### Final Checklist

Please remember to do the following:

* [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure your report is a new issue
* [ ] Recreate the issue after disabling all extensions
* [ ] Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!

### Follow Your Issue

Once submitted, your report will be reviewed by the team. We may ask for additional information to help us understand and reproduce the issue.

## Contributing Fixes

If you are interested in writing code to fix issues:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests to ensure everything works
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description

## Thank You

Your contributions to open source, large or small, make great projects like this possible. Thank you for taking the time to contribute.
